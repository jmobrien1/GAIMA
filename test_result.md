# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Build GAIMA (Getting Around Illinois Mobile Application) MVP with interactive map, data layers, onboarding flow, and audio alerts system"

backend:
  - task: "Map Data Layer APIs"

      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "All 7 layer endpoints (/api/layers/traffic, /api/layers/construction, /api/layers/closures, /api/layers/incidents, /api/layers/weather, /api/layers/winter, /api/layers/restrictions) are working correctly. Each endpoint returns proper JSON with data array, last_updated timestamp, and count. All data points have the required fields (id, type, location, title, details, severity, timestamp) and coordinates are within Illinois bounds. The incidents layer successfully updates in real-time with new data every 30 seconds as verified by comparing data before and after the update interval."

        comment: "Implemented POST /api/alerts/lookahead endpoint that takes user location/heading and returns hazard alerts within 2-mile radius"
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "The look-ahead alert system API (/api/alerts/lookahead) is working correctly. It properly accepts POST requests with latitude, longitude, and heading parameters. Testing with various Illinois locations (Chicago, Springfield, Peoria) and different headings (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) successfully triggered alerts when hazards were nearby. The API returns proper JSON responses with alert boolean and message string. Random coordinate testing within Illinois bounds also worked as expected."

      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Map loads correctly and is centered on Illinois. OpenStreetMap tiles display properly. Layer toggle button in top-right works correctly. Successfully tested toggling individual layers on/off. Verified exclusivity rule: when Winter layer is toggled on, Traffic layer is automatically turned off. Map markers appear correctly when layers are active (55 markers found). Clicking on markers shows popup with details including title, details, severity, and timestamp. Status information at bottom-left correctly shows active layers and point counts."

      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Terms of Use modal appears correctly on first visit. Accept button becomes enabled after scrolling to the bottom of terms. After accepting terms, Safety Warning modal appears as expected. Safety warning can be dismissed with 'I Understand' button. On subsequent visits, only Safety Warning appears (terms acceptance persists in localStorage). The onboarding flow works correctly on both desktop and mobile resolutions."

        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Audio alerts toggle in settings modal works correctly. When enabled, status information shows 'ðŸ”Š Audio Alerts ON' indicator. The settings modal can be opened and closed properly. Note: Actual audio functionality using Web Speech API and geolocation tracking could not be fully tested in the automated testing environment, but the UI components and toggle functionality work as expected."

The look-ahead alert system successfully detects hazards within a 2-mile radius and provides appropriate alerts. All location coordinates are properly within Illinois bounds. No issues found with the backend implementation."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed comprehensive frontend testing. All core features are working correctly. The interactive map loads properly with OpenStreetMap tiles and is centered on Illinois. Layer toggle functionality works as expected with proper exclusivity rule between Traffic and Winter layers. Map markers display correctly and show detailed popups when clicked. The onboarding flow with Terms of Use and Safety Warning modals works correctly, including scroll-to-accept functionality and localStorage persistence. Settings modal and audio alerts toggle work properly. The application is responsive and functions well on both desktop and mobile resolutions. No major issues found with the frontend implementation."
